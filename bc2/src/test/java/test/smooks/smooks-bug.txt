http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MILYN-553
I have a Java class that contains two variables of the same User-defined Class which in turn contains non-simple type variables, e.g

public class Person {
   private Address addr1;
   private Address addr2; 

}

public class Address{
   private City city;
}

public class City {
   private String name;
}

When use ConfigGenerator to generate the template config file, (Also it's same problem when using JBoss Tool's Smooks Eclipse plug-in)

the config file will be generated as: 
	<jb:bean beanId="person" class="Person" createOnElement="$TODO$">
		<jb:wiring beanIdRef="addr1" property="addr1"/>
		<jb:wiring beanIdRef="addr2" property="addr2"/>
	</jb:bean>
  <jb:bean beanId="addr1" class="Address" createOnElement="$TODO$">
    <jb:wiring beanIdRef="city" property="city"/>
  </jb:bean>
 <jb:bean beanId="city" class="City" createOnElement="$TODO$">
    <jb:value data="$TODO$" decoder="String" property="name"/
  </jb:bean>
  <jb:bean beanId="addr2" class="Address" createOnElement="$TODO$">
    <jb:wiring beanIdRef="city" property="city"/>
  </jb:bean>
  <jb:bean beanId="city" class="City" createOnElement="$TODO$">
    <jb:value data="$TODO$" decoder="String" property="name"/
  </jb:bean>

This is not correct, as the same beanId="city" is used twice. 

This is a big trouble when I have a big Class structure to map and the template-gen does not really work. 

Also the JbossTools's smooks Eclipse plug-in has the same problem generating wrong smooks config file from a Java Class.


Cause and fix:
The generation tool has to consider the possible of beanId conflication rather than simply let beanId=property's name;
