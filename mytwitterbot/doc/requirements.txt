
Admin area where I can see who uses the app , how many twitter accoundts they have and how many tweets they sent .

and also be able to set the price per message sent from the admin area, or edit a user (delete, suspend, set password.)

improve the login alternativewith OpendID or signup(username + password)

make it properly fetch content from rss feeds.

everytime a user upload a tweet file, before confirmation, the system compute the number of tweets message with the cost per tweet

and then redirect the user to paypal for payment, after payment, user is redirected back to the user admin panel and everything's fine to go.
  
that's pretty much it.
